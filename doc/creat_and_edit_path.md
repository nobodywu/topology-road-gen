## [Google Earth Tutorial: Paths](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/gticommunity/bVMYEgPzlA0)

### What is a Path? 

A "path" in Google Earth is a series of vertices tessellated together to form a line. In the KML code is a member of the `<Placemark>` family. 

### Creating Paths 

There are a number of ways to add KML objects in Google Earth. The three simplest methods are:

- Use the Menus (Add -> Path) 
- Click on the icon (showing three dots) in the Toolbar 
- Right-click on a folder in the Sidebar and select Add -> Path 

When the dialog box appears move the cursor into the 3D Earth browser, and `click` (we recommend `press-move-release`)on the globe to create vertices. These will automatically become connected by thin white line segments to create a path. 

To change the thickness/color/opacity of the Path select options under the "Style, Color" tab in the dialog box. 

### Editing Paths 

To edit a path re-open the dialog box by selecting the path in the sidebar (click on it so it is highlighted in light blue) and right-click (ctrl-click on Mac). Select Properties (PC) or Get Info (Mac) at the bottom of the menu that appears.

When the dialog box appears the vertices of the path will appear in the 3D browser as square red dots.

- To Select a Vertex for Editing - Roll the cursor over the chosen vertex (it will turn green) and left-click on the vertex (it will turn blue)

- To Delete a Vertex – Select a vertex and press delete (or backspace)

- To Move a Vertex – Select a vertex. Hold down the left-click and drag the vertex to a new location

- To Add a Vertex – Select a vertex (see above) in at the segment of the path to add vertices to, and click in the 3D browser. If no vertex is selected, clicking in the 3D browser will add vertices to the end of the path.
